### REFLECTION REPORT
Working on a project that required me to Crop, Cleanse, and Refactor Data in Excel Using Pandas was the task at hand. This was the project's first step, which involved manipulating large datasets to make them usable for further analysis.

This task was difficult for me because it required a solid understanding of data structures and how to manipulate them using pandas. However, by consulting the pandas documentation and experimenting with various methods, I was able to successfully complete the task. Overall, I believe that this task improved my understanding of data manipulation techniques.

The next step in the project was to create and implement a relational database (MySQL). I had to spend time learning about the basics of database design, Workbench and SQL. I found the process of designing the database schema and implementing it in MySQL to be time-consuming but rewarding.

The final step was to write python scripts to populate the database and generate SQL, design, write and run SQL queries, Model, implement and query a selected NoSQL database. This task required me to tie everything together and put my knowledge to the test. I found this task to be challenging, but I was able to complete it successfully with the help of learning materials used during the various workshops. Overall, I believe that this project has helped me to improve my skills in data manipulation, database design, and SQL.
One of the problems I faced in writing the query is to handle the time zone. I had to convert the time zone to UTC and then convert it to the local time zone. I was able to solve this problem by using the CONVERT_TZ function in MySQL.


One of the things I learned during this project is that I need to spend more time practicing SQL queries and familiarize myself with different types of NoSQL databases. In the future, I plan to continue learning and practicing these skills in order to become more proficient in working with databases.
There are a lot of helper tools that pandas present and I plan to spend time to understand how to efficiently use pandas inbuilt functions in solving problems .


#### Data Visualization
Given the task about there are number of visualizations that can be generated.
Using Matplotlib  I can generate the following visualizations:
1. A bar chart showing the various types of reading metrics example VPM2.5, PM2.5, Air Pressure and their respective counts by years.
2. The difference in pollution during weekends and weekdays using line graphs.

Using Plotly Python Library I can generate the following visualizations:
1. A map chart showing the various locations of the sensors and their respective readings.
2. A map chart showing locations with high air pollution levels.
